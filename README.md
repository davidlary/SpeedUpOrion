## 📋 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**"No module named 'psutil'" or import errors**
- Install required dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Or install manually: `pip3 install psutil`
- Ensure you're using Python 3.6+ with pip3

**"Orion data directory not found"**
- Ensure Orion browser is installed
- Check if you've launched Orion at least once

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Close Orion completely before running
- Run from Terminal, not through other applications

**"Failed to close Orion"**
- Manually quit Orion from Dock or Activity Monitor
- Rerun the script

### **Advanced Diagnostic Issues:**

**"Still slow after 100/100 performance score"**
- The script now automatically runs **advanced diagnostics**
- Checks for: problematic extensions, database corruption, system thermal throttling, network issues
- Look for specific recommendations in the advanced analysis

**"High CPU usage detected"**
- Restart Orion if it's been running >24 hours
- Check for runaway tabs or extensions
- Consider closing unused browser windows

**"Extension performance issues found"**
- Temporarily disable suspected extensions one by one
- Ad blockers, password managers, and shopping extensions commonly cause slowdowns
- Check extension data sizes in the analysis

**"Database integrity issues"**
- Backup your data first (script does this automatically)
- Consider clearing browsing history if databases are corrupted
- Restart Orion after cleanup

### **Reverting Changes:**

If you need to undo optimizations:
1. **Settings:** Copy `preferences_backup.plist` back to `preferences.plist`
2. **Files:** Restore from the Desktop backup folder
3. **Complete Reset:** Delete Orion data folder and restart (loses all data)

## 🔄 Maintenance Schedule

For optimal performance:
- **Weekly:** Run diagnostic mode to check cache growth
- **Monthly:** Full cleanup and optimization
- **After major updates:** Re-run optimizations

## 💡 Additional Tips

### **System-Level Optimizations:**
- Restart your Mac weekly to clear system caches
- Keep macOS updated for optimal browser performance
- Consider using fewer browser extensions
- Close unused tabs to free up memory
- Enable "Reduce motion" in macOS for smoother performance

### **When to Run:**
- **After major browsing sessions** (lots of video, downloads)
- **When Orion feels sluggish** on startup or during use
- **Before important work** requiring fast browsing
- **Monthly maintenance** for preventive care
- **When you get "100/100" score but still experience slowness** (triggers advanced diagnostics automatically)

### **Specific Scenarios for Tool Usage:**

**🎯 When Safari/Chrome work fine but Orion is slow:**
- **Use standard tool** → `python3 speed_up_orion.py`
- **Compares extension counts** → Orion vs Safari extension differences
- **Analyzes profile corruption** → Lock files, crash logs, corrupted preferences
- **Checks Orion-specific settings** → Developer tools, resource statistics, storage policies
- **Compares browser data sizes** → History, cache, and database size differences

**🚨 When Orion has spinning wheel of death:**
- **Use emergency tool** → `python3 fix_orion_spinning_wheel.py`
- **Force-kills stuck processes** → Handles completely frozen Orion
- **Cleans massive profile corruption** → Removes 100MB+ bloated data
- **Includes iOS cleanup** → Cross-device optimization guidance
- **Preserves bookmarks** → Safe emergency cleanup

**🔍 General performance issues:**
- **Typing lag in web forms** → Detects problematic extensions like Grammarly
- **Browser crashes or freezes** → Identifies database corruption and memory issues
- **Sluggish scrolling/animations** → Analyzes GPU cache and hardware acceleration settings
- **High memory usage** → Process monitoring and WebKit networking issues

**📱 Cross-device sync slowdowns:**
- **iOS Orion also slow** → Both tools provide iOS optimization steps
- **History sync causing lag** → Guidance on disabling problematic sync
- **Automatic sync propagation** → Mac cleanup affects iOS within 30 minutes

### **Performance & Timing:**
- **Basic diagnosis**: 2-5 seconds (cache analysis, history, system info)
- **Advanced diagnosis**: 10-15 seconds (process monitoring, database checks, network tests)
- **Total optimization**: 15-30 seconds (including cleanup and settings)

The script is optimized for speed with:
- ⚡ **0.1s CPU sampling** (instead of 1s) for faster process analysis
- ⚡ **2s timeouts** on system commands to prevent hanging
- ⚡ **3s DNS timeout** to avoid network delays
- ⚡ **Progress indicators** so you know what's happening
- ⚡ **Skip empty databases** to avoid unnecessary checks

## 🤝 Support

**⚠️ Remember: This software comes with NO WARRANTY and NO GUARANTEED SUPPORT**

If you encounter issues, you can try these self-help steps:
1. Check the backup folder for file restoration
2. Restart Orion and your Mac
3. Run the diagnostic mode only (don't clean) to identify problems

**Community Support:**
- **GitHub Issues:** Report bugs at [github.com/davidlary/orion-speed-optimizer](https://github.com/davidlary/orion-speed-optimizer) *(Note: Support provided on best-effort basis only)*
- **Contact:** davidlary@me.com *(No guarantee of response or resolution)*

### **Advanced Troubleshooting Steps:**

**If script shows 100/100 but Orion still slow:**
1. Let advanced diagnostics run completely (wait for the 10-15 second analysis)
2. Follow specific recommendations for detected issues
3. Consider temporarily disabling flagged extensions
4. Restart Orion if it's been running >24 hours
5. Change DNS servers if resolution is slow (>500ms)

**If "Checking system performance factors" seems slow:**
- This is normal - it checks thermal throttling, memory pressure, and CPU frequency
- Should complete within 5-10 seconds with the new optimizations
- Shows progress with system load, swap usage, and memory percentage
- If it hangs, the script now has 2-3 second timeouts on all system commands

**If issues persist after optimization:**
1. Check Activity Monitor for high CPU/memory usage
2. Reset Orion to defaults (will lose settings but keep bookmarks/passwords)
3. Consider fresh Orion installation
4. Check for macOS updates and restart system
